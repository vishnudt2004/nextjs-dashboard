| Chapter 12           | Mutating Data                | learned React Server Actions, revalidatePath, revalidateTag, and redirect from next/cache; acknowledged Next.js caching (page cache); dynamic route segments (e.g., [param-name], [id]) and page params (e.g., id, slug) - use params special prop; worked with JS FormData object and Function.prototype.bind; acknowledged that passing ID via hidden input is possible but discouraged due to sensitive data risks in the DOM; form's action attribute is a special prop in React (creates POST API endpoint), unlike in pure HTML; used 'use server' directive (inside a function/action in a component or in a separate module (e.g., actions.ts)); validated form data using a library like zod; acknowledged tree-shaking (unused code removed in final bundle); DB concepts like UUIDs, auto-increment keys, ID collisions, and enumeration attacks; Server Actions benefits - security (encrypted closures, strict input checks, error message hashing, host restrictions), and progressive enhancement (forms work without JS - e.g., on slow connections); validated and filtered form data before inserting into the DB (type validation and coercion); implemented create/update/delete invoice (flow: capture inputs from form, call server action on submit, extract and validate FormData, insert/update/delete DB record, revalidate cache, redirect to correct page; update additionally uses a dynamic segment and pre-populated form); implemented fully working pages for /dashboard/invoices/create, /dashboard/invoices/[id]/edit, and delete button in /dashboard/invoices (except error handling). |
| Chapter 13           | Handling Errors              | handle errors with JS's try/catch in server actions (note: Next.js skips code after try/catch if an error is caught); use special files - error.tsx (client component, special props: error, reset; catch-all for unexpected errors and shows fallback UI), not-found.tsx (404 page, shown by calling the notFound method), and the notFound method from next/navigation (handles missing resources or pages; takes precedence over error.tsx); implemented error fallback UI for /dashboard/invoices (including its children) and 404 page for /dashboard/invoices/[id]/edit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
